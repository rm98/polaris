## v0.3.0 (2022-03-12)

### Features

* Removed the default `ServiceMonitor` selector in the `3-service-monitor.yaml` files and improved the inline documentation about these selectors.
* Changed the default `PROMETHEUS_HOST` in the `2-slo-controller.yaml` and `2-metrics-controller.yaml` files to `prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus.monitoring.svc` to match the updated tutorial using the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) helm chart.
